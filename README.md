Wrangler is an set of software services for [picos](http://www.windley.com/archives/2015/11/reactive_programming_with_picos.shtml). 

Wrangler lets developers of reactive systems using picos:

* Write less code for *speed to market*
* Easily create *inter-pico channels* that support rich sharing.
* Use event-based programming for *real-time interactions*
* Support *User control* of data and privacy-by-design

Wrangler is open source. 

Wrangler is the replacement for an earlier operating system for picos (which were then called personal clouds) called CloudOS. Here are a few earlier topics on CloudOS.
