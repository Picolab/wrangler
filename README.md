Wrangler is an open-source set of software services for [picos](http://www.windley.com/archives/2015/11/reactive_programming_with_picos.shtml). 

Wrangler provides developers and users alike with significant benefits, including:

* Less code to write for *speed to market*
* Support for *inter-pico channels* that support rich sharing.
* Event-based for *real-time interactions*
* *User control* of data and privacy-by-design
* Open source

Wrangler is the replacement for an earlier operating system for picos (which were then called personal clouds) called CloudOS. Here are a few earlier topics on CloudOS.
